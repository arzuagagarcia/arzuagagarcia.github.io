Ignacio is a Ph.D. student working with Prof. Einstein in the Rock Mechanics group. Originally from Argentina, he graduated from the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) in 2013. He worked for 3 years as a structural engineer before joining MIT in 2016. His research combines imaging techniques with data analysis and acoustic emissions to learn about fracture mechanics in rocks. The main applications of his work are in geo-energy systems (like geothermal energy and unconventional oil & gas), and energy storage.
